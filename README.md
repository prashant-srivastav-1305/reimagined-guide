A supermarket billing program. 
<br> 
This takes in the key codes of the products, the quantity you want to buy  
and then prints a bill as well
<br>

<b>Initial update:</b> The project is still in dev, and I have finalised the initial list<br> 
of products..... will be adding more products as the time passes :) <br>
The printing of bill is to be added as well

<b>Update 2:</b> The project is now finalised, there are the following changes: <br>
<ol type="I">
  <li>Added a new employee_info file so that only authorised people can access the program</li>
  <li>Finalised the main.py file... displayed the data using pandas and tabulate modules</li>
</ol>
